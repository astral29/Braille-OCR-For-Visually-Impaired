# Braille-OCR-For-Visually-Impaired
The goal of this project is to design an aid to allow people who are visually-impaired to easily read text found on images. Using OpenCv for image preprocessing and PyTesseract for optical character recognition. The recognised text/characters are then sent to Arduino and using 6 vibration motors the text gets converted to Braille script.
